## 2. Modules

### ðŸ”¹ 1. Requirement Upload & Classification
- **Input**: Raw PDF requirements
- **Output**: Grouped user stories by SDLC phase
- **Tech**: PyMuPDF, Watsonx

### ðŸ”¹ 2. AI Code Generator
- Converts user stories into boilerplate or production code.
- Supports Python, JS, and more.

### ðŸ”¹ 3. Bug Fixer
- Takes buggy code and returns corrected version with explanation.

### ðŸ”¹ 4. Test Case Generator
- Auto-generates `unittest` or `pytest` cases from logic or requirements.

### ðŸ”¹ 5. Code Summarizer
- Translates code into human-readable summary (useful for onboarding/dev docs).

### ðŸ”¹ 6. AI Chatbot Assistant
- LangChain-based chat assistant for real-time help during development.
